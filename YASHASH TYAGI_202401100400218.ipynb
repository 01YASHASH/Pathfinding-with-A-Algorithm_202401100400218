INTRODUCTION

Pathfinding algorithms are designed to navigate a path from a starting point to a goal, traversing through a grid or graph while avoiding obstacles. These algorithms are the backbone of many real-world applications, enabling autonomous robots to navigate their environments, characters in video games to find their way through complex terrains, and GPS systems to provide the shortest route from one location to another. The primary goal of a pathfinding algorithm is to find the most efficient path, minimizing the cost, time, or distance traveled.
The A* algorithm operates by maintaining a priority queue of nodes, known as the open list. It begins at the starting node and explores neighboring nodes, calculating the total cost for each node using the formula:
				f(n)=g(n)+h(n)
*  f(n) represents the total estimated cost of the path through node nn.
*  g(n) denotes the actual cost from the starting node to node nn.
*  h(n) is the heuristic function that estimates the cost from node nn to the goal node.

METHODOLOGY
Methodology for Pathfinding Using the A* Algorithm
Step 1: Define the Problem
1. Grid Representation: Represent the environment as a grid or graph, where each cell or node can either be traversable or contain an obstacle. This can be a 2D grid, weighted graph, or any other suitable representation.
2. Start and Goal Nodes: Identify the starting point and the goal point within the grid. The objective is to find the most efficient path from the start node to the goal node while avoiding obstacles.
Step 2: Initialize the Open and Closed Lists
1. Open List: The open list contains nodes that need to be evaluated. It starts with only the start node.
2. Closed List: The closed list contains nodes that have already been evaluated. It starts empty.
Step 3: Calculate Costs and Heuristics
1. Cost Calculation: For each node, calculate the following costs:
o g(n)g(n): The actual cost from the start node to node nn.
o h(n)h(n): The heuristic estimate of the cost from node nn to the goal node. This can be calculated using various heuristic functions such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or Chebyshev distance.
2. Total Cost: Calculate the total cost f(n)=g(n)+h(n)f(n) = g(n) + h(n) for each node. The node with the lowest f(n)f(n) value will be prioritized for evaluation.
Step 4: Evaluate Nodes
1. Current Node: Select the node with the lowest f(n)f(n) value from the open list and set it as the current node.
2. Goal Check: If the current node is the goal node, the algorithm terminates, and the path is reconstructed by tracing back from the goal node to the start node.
3. Move to Closed List: Remove the current node from the open list and add it to the closed list, indicating that it has been evaluated.
Step 5: Explore Neighbors
1. Neighbor Nodes: Identify all traversable neighbor nodes of the current node. For each neighbor:
o If the neighbor is already in the closed list, skip it.
o If the neighbor is not in the open list, add it to the open list and calculate its g(n)g(n), h(n)h(n), and f(n)f(n) values.
2. Path Update: If the new path to the neighbor node is shorter than the previously known path, update the neighbor's g(n)g(n) and f(n)f(n) values, and set the current node as the neighbor's parent node.
Step 6: Repeat
1. Iteration: Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the open list is empty or the goal node is reached.
2. Path Reconstruction: Once the goal node is reached, reconstruct the path by tracing back from the goal node to the start node using the parent nodes.
